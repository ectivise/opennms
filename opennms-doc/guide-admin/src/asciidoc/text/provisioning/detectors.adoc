Service detectors allow to bind a service to an interface automatically if it is detected during provisioning of a requisition.

==== Metadata DSL
Service detectors can use link:#ga-meta-data-dsl[MetaData DSL](domain specific language) to leverage dynamic configuration in parameter values to interpolate metadata into the parameter. 

The syntax allows for the use of patterns in an expression, whereby the metadata is replaced with a corresponding value during the collection process.

During evaluation of an expression, the following scopes are available:

* Node metadata
* Interface metadata
